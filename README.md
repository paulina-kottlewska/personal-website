# Personal Website

This project is an interactive personal website. Initially developed as part of the CS50: Introduction to Computer Science course to improve my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I restructured it to incorporate more JavaScript and enhance its interactivity and visual appeal. The website features a responsive design with parallax scrolling, a carousel displaying my favorite books, and two tab lists presenting my past trips and travel bucket list. 

Technologies used:

* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* Responsive design

## Features
1. Parallax Scrolling: The website utilizes simple CSS code to create a visually appealing parallax scrolling effect.
2. Carousel: The carousel shows my favorite books. Hovering over each book reveals its description.
3. Tab Lists: The website features two tab lists, presenting my past trips and travel bucket list. I developed a tab list following the course on Scrimba with Kevin Powell. Later, I adjusted the code to work for more than one tab list.
